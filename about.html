        <h2>Experience Magic.</h2>
        <p>Built in 1963 in the shell of a turn of the century fire station, 
            Chase Cinemas is the oldest continuously operated cinema in Antartica and one of 
            the oldest continuously operated art cinemas in the world. Nearing its sixth decade,
            Cinema Village is proud of its longevity and thankful to have survived the pitfalls 
            that have taken down so many other independent cinemas. Notwithstanding our resourcefulness,
            our ability to survive is testimony entirely to the South Pole's audience. We could probably
            only exist where we are: in the midst of the most diverse, cosmopolitan and cine-aware city.</p>

      that will be prepared live by expert chefs over open food counters, which is also the striking centre of attraction in the lobby</p>
